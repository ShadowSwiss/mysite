      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While in Switzerland, public debt draws significant attention, there is one type of debt that seems to escape scrutiny: household debt. According to researcher Solène Morvant-Roux, «there is sometimes a sense of indifference towards this issue»&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This lack of concern is particularly troubling given the central role debt plays in Swiss households. In today&amp;rsquo;s era of financialization&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, household indebtedness and investment have become routine financial practices&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. This is evident in &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1&lt;/strong&gt; below, which highlights the extent of Swiss household financialization, measured by debt as a percentage of GDP, in comparison to the United States, Germany, France, Austria, and the United Kingdom from 1999 to 2022. Swiss households are significantly more indebted than their international counterparts, with debt levels exceeding 100% of the country&amp;rsquo;s GDP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/HTML/Fig1.html&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this Swiss anomaly, it has attracted surprisingly little political or analytical attention. This oversight is particularly striking given that such high levels of indebtedness contradict the prevailing notion of Switzerland as a land of wealth and prosperity. In fact, household debt is a key factor driving inequality in the country&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article aims to explore the underlying correlations that explain the financialization of Swiss households. To do so, it undertakes an econometric analysis, while also considering the political context and historical background behind the variables examined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-household-indebtedness-is-problematic-and-how-could-we-explain-it&#34;&gt;Why household indebtedness is problematic and how could we explain it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mainstream economic theory, household debt was long perceived as beneficial for the economy&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. However, it is increasingly recognized that medium and long-term indebtedness is particularly problematic. Since the 2008 crisis, which saw widespread mortgage defaults trigger one of the most severe economic crises in the history of capitalism, no economist views household debt as risk-free. A recent IMF report even warns of potential dangers: «Growth is slower than it would have been otherwise, and the odds of a financial crisis increase»&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More specifically, the report notes that «highly indebted households may need to cut back on spending to repay their loans. That&amp;rsquo;s a drag on growth. And as the 2008 crisis demonstrated, a sudden economic shock, such as a decline in home prices, can trigger a spiral of credit defaults that shakes the foundations of the financial system.&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;»&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aware of the risks induced by households debt, the literature has devoted considerable attention to its causes. According to a selection of non-exhaustive articles&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, household debt can be explained by real estate variables (house prices; mortgage credit interest rates), labor variables (unemployment; real wages; income inequality; working age population), public finances (public expenditures; public deficit) and financial asset prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;econometric-analysis&#34;&gt;Econometric analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To create our model for the period 1999-2022, we excluded variables linked to property ownership, since 61% of Swiss households are tenants&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;; and financial asset prices, which decrease the explanation of our model. In order to avoid multicollinearity, we select only one labor independent variable, real wages, which has the advantage to take into account inflation in the model. We then added public spending and public debt as a proportion of GDP as independent variables. The model presented in equation (1) explains 85% of the variance in households debt and performed satisfactorily in multicollinearity tests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Table 1&lt;/strong&gt; below presents the results of our econometric model, showing that each independent variable has statistically significant coefficients. This indicates that all the variables are meaningfully correlated with households debt as a proportion of GDP. To visually represent these findings, &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2&lt;/strong&gt; illustrates the correlation diagrams for each independent variable, offering the following key insights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing the public debt reduces households debt. This suggests that public debt is not inherently harmful and, in the Swiss case, may even be beneficial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rising real wages (i.e., purchasing power) reduces households debt. This implies that improving workers&amp;rsquo; purchasing power could lower households debt, indicating that debt is often a response to social needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher public expenditures increase households debt. This could mean that increased public spending does not always financially support households, and/or that additional spending is financed through higher revenues extracted directly from households, which can have counterproductive effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/HTML/table.html&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;400&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/HTML/Fig2.html&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the results for real wages and public debt may seem intuitive, the finding on public spending is more surprising. It is therefore important to examine more closely the links between public expenditures and household debt in Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;examining-the-correlation-between-public-expenditures-and-household-debt&#34;&gt;Examining the correlation between public expenditures and household debt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3&lt;/strong&gt; provides an overview of the socio-political sources of Swiss central government revenue as a proportion of GDP from 1990 to 2022. It clearly shows that, like many other countries entering the neoliberal era, Switzerland «shifted a portion of the tax burden from capital owners to the majority of wage earners»&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Indeed, in 1990, the shares of revenue attributed to households and capital&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; were roughly equivalent as a proportion of GDP. However, from 1994 onwards, following the end of turnover taxation, capital&amp;rsquo;s contribution to the Confederation’s revenues steadily declined, disproportionately affecting households. This suggests that increased public expenditures alone does not alleviate household financial strain if a large portion of that spending is financed by households themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/HTML/Fig3.html&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, in Switzerland&amp;rsquo;s historically anti-Keynesian context&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, with relatively low public spending, the introduction of the debt brake in 2003 has further constrained the government’s ability to provide financial support to households. Although the debt brake can be temporarily relaxed in response to economic conditions, Swiss law generally requires that any increase in public expenditure be matched by a corresponding rise in revenue. This mechanism typically limits public spending or, at best, keeps it fixed in real terms&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4&lt;/strong&gt; illustrates the variations in public spending on households&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in Switzerland and the Eurozone from 1999 to 2022, expressed as a percentage of GDP. One critical point is that, over this period, Swiss public spending on households averaged 15% of GDP, compared to 28% in the Eurozone. Notably, Switzerland has seen a reduction in public spending relative to 1999, except during the two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, in contrast to the trend in the Eurozone. This shows that, while public expenditures is on the rise, it is targeting other areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/HTML/Fig4.html&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This comparison therefore highlights Switzerland&amp;rsquo;s restricted fiscal environment, where limited public spending, combined with the transfer of the tax burden to households and the failure to increase public expenditures on households, has probably exacerbated the problem of household indebtedness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;opening-ideology-overproduction-crisis-banking-power-and-financial-instability&#34;&gt;Opening: Ideology, overproduction crisis, banking power and financial instability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To sum up, we have demonstrated that the high indebtedness of Swiss households is largely due to limited purchasing power and restrictive public finances. This reveals how socially underdeveloped the Swiss economy is. Employers and corporations wield such significant power that they are able to limit real wages growth, leaving households to turn to debt as a compensatory measure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The role of public finances, however, is more complex. The stringent control over public debt and, more broadly, the obsession with “balancing” public finances seem detached from economic realities. As we have previously noted, Switzerland has never experienced large-scale public spending&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, which makes the alarmist discourse around its public finances appear exaggerated. The &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5&lt;/strong&gt; below shows Swiss public debt as a proportion of GDP from 1986 to 2022, compared to France, Austria, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. This demonstrates Switzerland’s relatively modest debt levels in an international context. Combined with a favorable economic environment, some economists have even suggested that Switzerland has room to increase deficits, arguing that austerity measures are unnecessary&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Others have pointed out that historically, Swiss public debt has had no adverse effects on growth or interest rates&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:17&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/HTML/Fig5.html&#34; width=&#34;100%&#34; height=&#34;500&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34;&gt;
&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This evidence supports the argument that public debt, and public finance policy more broadly, primarily serve a political purpose&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:18&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:18&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The aim is to curtail social spending, despite the lack of empirical support for such a policy&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:19&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:19&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The justification is purely ideological. As economist Olivier Blanchard noted, «it is clear that we can probably tolerate debt levels above 100% in many countries, and it’s not the end of the world»&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:20&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:20&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this ideological stance has tangible consequences. Combined with declining demand due to limited purchasing power, the dominance of corporations forces Swiss households into greater debt. This debt serves a critical economic function: it compensates for overproduction. Supply and demand do not naturally balance out; rather, they are sustained by a banking system that capitalizes on low purchasing power and lack of public spending, often at the expense of household financial stability. In other words, the entire Swiss production system now relies heavily on household credit, which grants the banking sector a central role from which it derives significant profits. Banks, in effect, have assumed the role that the state could have played, which in turn increases the risk of a financial crisis in Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are, however, solutions to this problem. We have shown that increasing wages reduces household indebtedness and possibly reduces the likelihood of a financial crisis in Switzerland. Additionally, increasing public spending targeted at household support, and not financed by households themselves, can also help improve household financial health. To achieve these, we need to overcome the Swiss ideology, rooted in a caricatured version of laissez-faire economics, which selectively applies this doctrine depending on who benefits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this approach, households are rational and seek to maintain their consumption over time (permanent income hypothesis and life cycle consumption). If the future budget constraint has an effect on their consumption, then households will go into debt and smooth out their consumption. Debt is therefore not negative and results solely from households&amp;rsquo; future expectations. For a review, see: Karacimen, E. (2013).

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Swiss economy has long been regarded as impervious to economic turmoil, lauded for its prosperity, robust performance, and macroeconomic stability&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Many view it as a resilient economic structure capable of withstanding any challenge. Amid such perceptions, few dare to suggest that it is in a state of disrepair, relegating critical analysis to the realm of the anecdotal and the improbable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to this simplistic viewpoint, this article aims to demonstrate the susceptibility of the Swiss economy to the structural economic changes that have emerged in recent decades. Specifically, it focuses on the impact of financialization on the profit and investment dynamics of non-financial corporations. In this context, financialization refers to the increasing influence of shareholders in corporate governance and its complex financial implications&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:2&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:2&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. One particular contradiction highlighted in the literature is the paradox of declining investment alongside increasing profits, commonly known as the &lt;em&gt;investment-profit puzzle&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:3&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:3&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While this puzzle has been observed in several countries&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:4&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:4&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, it has received minimal attention in Switzerland. Therefore, this article aims to examine the relationship between investment and profit within the Swiss context, beginning with a concise overview of the relevant literature. It subsequently delves into illustrating the profit-investment interconnection in Switzerland, ultimately offering insights into the sustainability of these dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;corporate-financialization-and-his-impact-on-the-profit-investment-nexus&#34;&gt;Corporate financialization and his impact on the profit-investment nexus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While financialization may refer to a new accumulation regime or the heightened influence of finance in everyday life&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:5&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:5&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, numerous studies have focused on its implications at the corporate level. In this corporate dimension, financialization specifically alludes to the emergence of &lt;em&gt;shareholder value orientation&lt;/em&gt; (SVO) in the 1980s in the United States, which amplified the power of shareholders in corporate governance&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:6&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:6&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. The literature emphasizes the financial consequences of this ascendant shareholder influence, particularly the shift from &lt;em&gt;retain and reinvest&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;downsize and distribute&lt;/em&gt;&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:7&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:7&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. In addition to the impact on headcount, these studies underscore the altered utilization of profits, with less being channeled into investments and more being distributed among shareholders&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:8&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:8&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While corporate financialization predominantly features at the microeconomic level, it has been employed in several studies to elucidate macroeconomic dynamics. Particularly, it has been invoked to explain the disparity between profits and investment at the macroeconomic level. Drawing from Kalecki&amp;rsquo;s profit equation&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:9&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:9&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, macroeconomic profits heavily rely on macroeconomic investment. Understanding this dependency necessitates a brief examination of this equation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a simplified framework where capitalists and workers are the primary agents, and with negligible government spending and consumption equating to wages, Kalecki&amp;rsquo;s equation can be expressed as follows&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:10&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:10&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Factoring in the absence of management and raw material purchases, the macroeconomic profits (Π) of corporations are the difference between their sales (SA) and total costs (TC). In this simplified equation (1), profit equals the disparity between prices (p) multiplied by quantities (Q) and wages paid (W):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Π = 𝑆𝐴 − 𝑇𝐶 = 𝑝𝑄 − 𝑊 (1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As prices multiplied by quantities correspond to aggregate demand, and with no public spending, profits can be expressed as the sum of consumption (C) and investment (I) - wages paid, as outlined in equation (2):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Π = 𝑝𝑄 − 𝑊 = (𝐶 + 𝐼) − 𝑊 (2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, while consumption equals wages (C=W) in a model where workers spend what they earn, profits are equivalent to investment, as indicated in equation (3). Introducing a causal relationship where investment drives profits renders Kalecki&amp;rsquo;s argument even more compelling: profits without investment are simply unattainable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Π = 𝐼 (3)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the relevance of this demonstration, Kalecki&amp;rsquo;s profit equation faces significant challenges in the era of financialization. Numerous studies highlight a profound paradox: despite the decline in investments under SVO pressure, profits continue to surge&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:11&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:11&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. To elucidate this paradox of profits without investment, some studies have been compelled to consider other explanatory variables, such as globalization and monopolization&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:12&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:12&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;profits-without-investment-or-no-profits-without-investment-&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Profits without investment&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;No profits without investment&lt;/em&gt; ?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before examining the profit-investment nexus within the Swiss context, it is crucial to briefly outline our methodology. Non-financial corporations&amp;rsquo; profits will be evaluated in terms of gross operating surplus, a metric that not only indicates profitability in relation to gross value added at the macroeconomic level&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:13&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:13&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; but also enables an examination of how profits are allocated. Specifically, it allows for an assessment of the proportion of profits distributed to shareholders and creditors versus those reinvested in productive capital&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:14&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:14&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Investment will be assessed in terms of gross capital formation, representing investment in productive capital&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:15&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:15&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Moreover, financialization will be evaluated based on shareholder payments relative to investment, capturing the essence of SVO and its downsize and distribute principle at the macroeconomic level&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:16&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:16&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. All data is drawn from the national accounts published by the Federal Statistical Office of Switzerland (FSO). However, the measurements of profitability, profit allocation, and financialization are the result of personal calculations for which the author of this article bears sole responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1&lt;/strong&gt; below depicts the profit-investment nexus in Switzerland amid the context of financialization. It illustrates the consistent increase in downsize and distribute by Swiss non-financial corporations compared to the decline in their profits between 1995 and 2022. With the exception of the late 1990s, dividends paid to shareholders have outpaced productive investment, while profit share witnessed a significant decline, notably between 2005 and 2020. Contrary to prevalant notions concerning its economy, Switzerland has undergone a dramatic transformation. Swiss non-financial corporations have distributed more than they have invested, leading to a decrease in their capacity to generate profits. By allocating a greater share of their profits to shareholders at the expense of investment, companies are endangering their long-term growth, aligning with Kalecki&amp;rsquo;s profit framework.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/financialization/UntitledRMD_files/Fig10.png&#34; alt=&#34;Figure 1&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-contradiction-of-profits&#34;&gt;The contradiction of profits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To bolster our argument, &lt;strong&gt;Figure 2&lt;/strong&gt; illustrates the trend of profits for Swiss non-financial corporations between 1995 and 2022. It demonstrates that while the share of profits going to creditors has declined and the share going to investors has remained relatively stable, the share going to shareholders has experienced a sharp rise. Since the advent of &lt;em&gt;financialization Mark II&lt;/em&gt; in the year 2000&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:17&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:17&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;, profits intended for shareholders have, on average, grown 2.84 times faster than those allocated for investment. This illustration serves as a secondary validation. With the ascent of SVO, the balance sheets of Swiss non-financial corporations have become increasingly precarious. Since 2014, more than 100% of profits have been expended, a phenomenon explicable by two dynamics: either corporate savings leading to the expenditure of more profits than exist, or increased corporate borrowing. In either scenario, this SVO pressure is not sustainable in the medium term. In the current environment of high inflation and increased interest rates, Swiss non-financial corporations are confronted with the decision of whether to curtail shareholder payouts or productive investment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;















&lt;figure  &gt;
  &lt;div class=&#34;d-flex justify-content-center&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;w-100&#34; &gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:4321/post/financialization/UntitledRMD_files/Fig2.png&#34; alt=&#34;Figure 2&#34; loading=&#34;lazy&#34; data-zoomable /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;concluding-remarks&#34;&gt;Concluding remarks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, it is essential to acknowledge that this article has not captured all the factors contributing to the decline in investment and profits. For instance, globalization may explain a potential shift of productive investments to third countries, while the monopolization of US technological firms could adversely impact the profit generation of Swiss non-financial corporations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite these limitations, this article delivers a critical lesson: contrary to the prevailing emphasis on Switzerland&amp;rsquo;s economic success and stability, it highlights a significant failure within the context of financialization. The profits of non-financial corporations have diminished as distribution to shareholders is prioritized over investment. Moreover, since 2014, this transformation has posed a notable challenge, leading to a contraction of corporate balance sheets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond its importance in understanding the contemporary Swiss economy, this article contributes more broadly to the literature concerning the &lt;em&gt;investment-profit puzzle&lt;/em&gt;. Indeed, it shows that unlike many national contexts, Switzerland does not have a puzzle. Continuing Kalecki&amp;rsquo;s profit equation, the declining macroeconomic investment leads to declining macroeconomic profits. Switzerland is therefore not faced with &lt;em&gt;profits without investment&lt;/em&gt;, but rather with &lt;em&gt;no profits without investment&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
