Many view it as a resilient economic structure capable of withstanding any challenge. Amid such perceptions, few dare to suggest that it is in a state of disrepair, relegating critical analysis to the realm of the anecdotal and the improbable.\nContrary to this simplistic viewpoint, this article aims to demonstrate the susceptibility of the Swiss economy to the structural economic changes that have emerged in recent decades. Specifically, it focuses on the impact of financialization on the profit and investment dynamics of non-financial corporations. In this context, financialization refers to the increasing influence of shareholders in corporate governance and its complex financial implications2. One particular contradiction highlighted in the literature is the paradox of declining investment alongside increasing profits, commonly known as the investment-profit puzzle3.\nWhile this puzzle has been observed in several countries4, it has received minimal attention in Switzerland. Therefore, this article aims to examine the relationship between investment and profit within the Swiss context, beginning with a concise overview of the relevant literature. It subsequently delves into illustrating the profit-investment interconnection in Switzerland, ultimately offering insights into the sustainability of these dynamics.\nCorporate financialization and his impact on the profit-investment nexus While financialization may refer to a new accumulation regime or the heightened influence of finance in everyday life5, numerous studies have focused on its implications at the corporate level. In this corporate dimension, financialization specifically alludes to the emergence of shareholder value orientation (SVO) in the 1980s in the United States, which amplified the power of shareholders in corporate governance6. The literature emphasizes the financial consequences of this ascendant shareholder influence, particularly the shift from retain and reinvest to downsize and distribute7. In addition to the impact on headcount, these studies underscore the altered utilization of profits, with less being channeled into investments and more being distributed among shareholders8.\nWhile corporate financialization predominantly features at the microeconomic level, it has been employed in several studies to elucidate macroeconomic dynamics. Particularly, it has been invoked to explain the disparity between profits and investment at the macroeconomic level. Drawing from Kalecki‚Äôs profit equation9, macroeconomic profits heavily rely on macroeconomic investment. Understanding this dependency necessitates a brief examination of this equation.\nUsing a simplified framework where capitalists and workers are the primary agents, and with negligible government spending and consumption equating to wages, Kalecki‚Äôs equation can be expressed as follows10. Factoring in the absence of management and raw material purchases, the macroeconomic profits (Œ†) of corporations are the difference between their sales (SA) and total costs (TC). In this simplified equation (1), profit equals the disparity between prices (p) multiplied by quantities (Q) and wages paid (W):\nŒ† = ùëÜùê¥ ‚àí ùëáùê∂ = ùëùùëÑ ‚àí ùëä (1)\nAs prices multiplied by quantities correspond to aggregate demand, and with no public spending, profits can be expressed as the sum of consumption (C) and investment (I) - wages paid, as outlined in equation (2):\nŒ† = ùëùùëÑ ‚àí ùëä = (ùê∂ + ùêº) ‚àí ùëä (2)\nHowever, while consumption equals wages (C=W) in a model where workers spend what they earn, profits are equivalent to investment, as indicated in equation (3). Introducing a causal relationship where investment drives profits renders Kalecki‚Äôs argument even more compelling: profits without investment are simply unattainable.\nŒ† = ùêº (3)\nDespite the relevance of this demonstration, Kalecki‚Äôs profit equation faces significant challenges in the era of financialization. Numerous studies highlight a profound paradox: despite the decline in investments under SVO pressure, profits continue to surge11. To elucidate this paradox of profits without investment, some studies have been compelled to consider other explanatory variables, such as globalization and monopolization12.\nProfits without investment or No profits without investment ? Before examining the profit-investment nexus within the Swiss context, it is crucial to briefly outline our methodology. Non-financial corporations‚Äô profits will be evaluated in terms of gross operating surplus, a metric that not only indicates profitability in relation to gross value added at the macroeconomic level13 but also enables an examination of how profits are allocated. Specifically, it allows for an assessment of the proportion of profits distributed to shareholders and creditors versus those reinvested in productive capital14.
