A recent documentary by Swiss television is titled How did the Swiss become so rich?1 while the liberal think tank Avenir Suisse recently pondered, Where does Switzerland’s prosperity originate?2. Although Switzerland’s wealth and prosperity might appear self-evident, determining which indicators truly capture these attributes is a complex task. This complexity often leads to a lack of clarity in the evidence presented by these sources. The indicators utilized can vary greatly and sometimes even suggest that Switzerland isn’t as affluent or prosperous as perceived when compared to other countries.\nConfirming this shadow complexity, this article aims to demonstrate that the inquiry into Swiss wealth and its implicit normative connection to prosperity and well-being is heavily reliant on the metrics employed. Just as with the previous article about unemployment, the analysis of causes is sidestepped by challenging how these normative concepts are defined and measured.\nThe historical convention of wealth measurement The question of what constitutes the wealth of a territory has been central to economic theory since its inception. The mercantilist, physiocrat, and classical3 schools focused on wealth to justify the economic power of the sovereign amidst the modern state’s emergence4.\nHowever, the development of a dominant and technically advanced measurement system was greatly enhanced by the context of the Second World War5. With the increasing demand for organizing war efforts, establishing national accounts became crucial6. Additionally, the emergence of Keynesian macroeconomics further emphasized the need for a production-oriented measure7. From that point on, wealth and macroeconomic performance began to be progressively measured in terms of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).\nThe diversity of GDP measures In macroeconomics, GDP is basically « the measure of aggregate output »8 : it measures the wealth produced by a given territory over a given year using cash flows.\nWhile this basic definition may seem straightforward, the method used to calculate GDP is multifaceted and more complex. Indeed, GDP can be calculated using three approaches: expenditure, income, and production. The most used approach, the expenditure approach, is represented by the following equation (1):\n$$ GDP=C+I+G+(X−M) \\quad \\text{(1)} $$ where\n$C$: Consumption by households $I$: Investment by companies $G$: Government spending $(X−M)$: Net exports, i.e Exports ($X$) minus Imports ($M$) As you could imagine, however, in an evolving economy, GDP at current prices, in itself is irrelevant. Indeed, « if our goal is to measure production and its change over time we need to eliminate the effect of increasing prices on our measure of GDP »9. In this context, the growth rate is used to evaluate GDP, which is the rate of change of GDP measured in volume, i.e at constant prices.\nAnother widely used measure is GDP per capita, which shows a country’s GDP divided by its total population. This measure is, however, often used not to indicate wealth, but to assess the well-being and standard of living of a geographical area. In order to correct variations in exchange rates and systematic differences in prices across countries, GDP per capita is often adapted using Purchasing Power Parities (PPP)10.\nGrowth and GDP per capita in a comparative perspective Figures 1 and 2 below present the GDP growth rate in PPP and GDP per capita growth rate in PPP for Switzerland, the Euro Zone, the European Union, the United States of America, France, Germany, and Austria from 7 cycles between 1991 to 2022. Coming from the World Bank database, these data were already adjusted at constant 2011 international PPP dollars. However, the GDP growth rate and GDP per capita growth rate were not available for every cycle and were therefore calculated using an arithmetic average of the two followings equations (2) and (3):\n$$ Gr_TP=(GDP_TP/GDP_tP)-1 *100 \\quad \\text{(2)} $$ where\n$Gr_TP$: Growth rate at constant 2011 international PPP dollars for year $T$. $GDP_TP$: GDP at constant 2011 international PPP dollars for year $T$. $GDP_tp$: GDP at constant 2011 international PPP dollars for previous year $t$. $$ Cr_ TP=(C_TP/C_tP)-1 *100 \\quad \\text{(3)} $$ where\n$Cr_TP$: GDP per capita growth rate at constant 2011 international PPP dollars for year $T$. $C_TP$: GDP per capita at constant 2011 international PPP dollars for year $T$. $C_tp$: GDP per capita at constant 2011 international PPP dollars for previous year $t$. Two main conclusions could be provided from Figures 1 and 2. First, Switzerland underperformed in most of the cycles. Indeed, if we exclude the 2006-2010 cycle (which is characterized by a Swiss performance) Switzerland’s GDP per capita growth rate and overall growth underperformed during the 1991-1995 cycle compared to other geographical entities and was the second worst in the …","date":1718928000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1718928000,"objectID":"848f367573d2797c0734dacbe76e9f10","permalink":"http://localhost:4321/post/2024-06-21-s-switzerland-truly-wealthy-well-being-and-prosperous/","publishdate":"2024-06-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2024-06-21-s-switzerland-truly-wealthy-well-being-and-prosperous/","section":"post","summary":"Introduction When one enters Why is Switzerland so rich? into Google, the results seem endless.

Despite the waning economic significance attributed to it with the rise of monetarism, which shifted focus from combating unemployment to combating inflation, economists still closely scrutinize its value. For instance, Blanchard’s recent macroeconomic manual positions unemployment as one of the key indicators of economic performance, trailing closely behind growth1.\nThis economic variable holds heightened importance within the Swiss context. As elucidated in two recent articles2, Switzerland appears to be excelling, nearing full employment. This exceptional scenario, a rarity on the global stage, is sometimes perceived as nearly miraculous. Certain authors in academic literature even go as far as labeling it a « miracle »3, solidifying Switzerland’s low unemployment rate as an established and undisputed fact.\nContrary to this prevailing narrative, the subsequent analysis critically examines the success of Switzerland’s unemployment rate. While Switzerland indeed possesses unique characteristics compared to international counterparts, the following discussion delves into the concept of unemployment and the manner in which statistics rationalize it. Thus, it sidesteps the analysis of the causes and consequences of unemployment trends and instead focuses on the question of what unemployment signifies and how it is measured in the Swiss context.\nUnemployment: A numeric entity or a social and historical construct? To begin with, it proves beneficial to establish a definition and comprehension of unemployment. In economics, unemployment is often quantified through the unemployment rate, defined as « the number of people who do not have a job but are looking for one »4. Assuming the labor force ($L$) comprises employment ($N$) and unemployment ($U$) (1), the unemployment rate ($u$) is calculated as the ratio of the number of unemployed individuals (2)5:\n$$ L = N + U \\quad \\text{(1)} $$\n$$ u = \\frac{U}{L} \\quad \\text{(2)} $$\nWhile this definition may appear straightforward, Blanchard cautions that « the unemployment rate is less obvious than it might seem »6.\nFrom a slightly different perspective, unemployment is sometimes conceptualized as « a historical and social construct specific to our Western societies… the result of a process that took place mainly at the end of the nineteenth century, at the beginning of the twentieth century and in the thirties »7. Within this political-economic framework, unemployment is neither self-evident nor static. Its measurement and definition fluctuate based on the evolution of the productive economic landscape, and the prevailing economic policies of a given era8.\nFurthermore, unemployment is, in itself, a legal standard that varies significantly from one country to another and evolves over time in response to political decisions9. Unlike the other, this perspective highlights, therefore, the challenge that lies behind its measurement.\nUnemployment rates and measurement issues Given the aforementioned complexities and the intricate nature of paid employment (including internships, outsourcing, mandates) and forms of inactivity not encompassed in traditional unemployment metrics (such as underemployment, school dropout rates, reliance on social assistance, etc.), few economists subscribe to the existence of a singular true unemployment figure. Despite the adoption of a common unemployment definition by all countries since 1982 through the International Labour Organization (ILO), according to Sheldon, an economics professor at Basel University, « there’s no such thing as a “true” unemployment number »10. The ILO definition allows indeed for considerable maneuvering, rendering international comparisons challenging11 and proving unsuitable for non-Western contexts12.\nConsequently, alternative indicators have emerged. While the number of measures varies by country, Switzerland primarily employs three main metrics13. Figure 1 below illustrates the disparity between these metrics, showcasing the variation in unemployment rates between the second quarter of 2022 and the fourth quarter of 2023. Throughout this period, the ILO unemployment rate consistently exceeds that reported by the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO). Notably, the jobless rate, which includes underemployment, stands significantly higher than both. The jobless rate is on average 102% higher than the indicator calculated according ILO’s definition and 338% higher than that of the SECO.\nThe discrepancies stem chiefly from variations in definitions and measurement methodologies employed by these indicators. SECO’s metric, a widely recognized measure used for economic policymaking, relies on the number of individuals registered as unemployed with employment offices at month-end. Despite its monthly publication advantage, this metric suffers from a notable weakness: individuals without a compelling reason to register, such as those who have …","date":1714867200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1714867200,"objectID":"c8f030328e6b67b2a9a6fc36debaca72","permalink":"http://localhost:4321/post/2024-05-03-reevaluating-switzerland-s-unemployment-success-story/","publishdate":"2024-05-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2024-05-03-reevaluating-switzerland-s-unemployment-success-story/","section":"post","summary":"Introduction In macroeconomic theory, unemployment is a key factor.

Many view it as a resilient economic structure capable of withstanding any challenge. Amid such perceptions, few dare to suggest that it is in a state of disrepair, relegating critical analysis to the realm of the anecdotal and the improbable.\nContrary to this simplistic viewpoint, this article aims to demonstrate the susceptibility of the Swiss economy to the structural economic changes that have emerged in recent decades. Specifically, it focuses on the impact of financialization on the profit and investment dynamics of non-financial corporations. In this context, financialization refers to the increasing influence of shareholders in corporate governance and its complex financial implications2. One particular contradiction highlighted in the literature is the paradox of declining investment alongside increasing profits, commonly known as the investment-profit puzzle3.\nWhile this puzzle has been observed in several countries4, it has received minimal attention in Switzerland. Therefore, this article aims to examine the relationship between investment and profit within the Swiss context, beginning with a concise overview of the relevant literature. It subsequently delves into illustrating the profit-investment interconnection in Switzerland, ultimately offering insights into the sustainability of these dynamics.\nCorporate financialization and his impact on the profit-investment nexus While financialization may refer to a new accumulation regime or the heightened influence of finance in everyday life5, numerous studies have focused on its implications at the corporate level. In this corporate dimension, financialization specifically alludes to the emergence of shareholder value orientation (SVO) in the 1980s in the United States, which amplified the power of shareholders in corporate governance6. The literature emphasizes the financial consequences of this ascendant shareholder influence, particularly the shift from retain and reinvest to downsize and distribute7. In addition to the impact on headcount, these studies underscore the altered utilization of profits, with less being channeled into investments and more being distributed among shareholders8.\nWhile corporate financialization predominantly features at the microeconomic level, it has been employed in several studies to elucidate macroeconomic dynamics. Particularly, it has been invoked to explain the disparity between profits and investment at the macroeconomic level. Drawing from Kalecki’s profit equation9, macroeconomic profits heavily rely on macroeconomic investment. Understanding this dependency necessitates a brief examination of this equation.\nUsing a simplified framework where capitalists and workers are the primary agents, and with negligible government spending and consumption equating to wages, Kalecki’s equation can be expressed as follows10. Factoring in the absence of management and raw material purchases, the macroeconomic profits (Π) of corporations are the difference between their sales (SA) and total costs (TC). In this simplified equation (1), profit equals the disparity between prices (p) multiplied by quantities (Q) and wages paid (W):\nΠ = 𝑆𝐴 − 𝑇𝐶 = 𝑝𝑄 − 𝑊 (1)\nAs prices multiplied by quantities correspond to aggregate demand, and with no public spending, profits can be expressed as the sum of consumption (C) and investment (I) - wages paid, as outlined in equation (2):\nΠ = 𝑝𝑄 − 𝑊 = (𝐶 + 𝐼) − 𝑊 (2)\nHowever, while consumption equals wages (C=W) in a model where workers spend what they earn, profits are equivalent to investment, as indicated in equation (3). Introducing a causal relationship where investment drives profits renders Kalecki’s argument even more compelling: profits without investment are simply unattainable.\nΠ = 𝐼 (3)\nDespite the relevance of this demonstration, Kalecki’s profit equation faces significant challenges in the era of financialization. Numerous studies highlight a profound paradox: despite the decline in investments under SVO pressure, profits continue to surge11. To elucidate this paradox of profits without investment, some studies have been compelled to consider other explanatory variables, such as globalization and monopolization12.\nProfits without investment or No profits without investment ? Before examining the profit-investment nexus within the Swiss context, it is crucial to briefly outline our methodology. Non-financial corporations’ profits will be evaluated in terms of gross operating surplus, a metric that not only indicates profitability in relation to gross value added at the macroeconomic level13 but also enables an examination of how profits are allocated. Specifically, it allows for an assessment of the proportion of profits distributed to shareholders and creditors versus those reinvested in productive capital14.
