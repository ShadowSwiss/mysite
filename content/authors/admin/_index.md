ShadowSwiss Economics is a website dedicated to shedding light on the lesser-known aspects of the Swiss economy. Recognizing the prevailing lack of analyses that adopt a pluralist approach, ShadowSwiss endeavors to offer an original and fresh perspective for economic thinking in Switzerland. By focusing on matters of public interest, ShadowSwiss aims to firmly ground economic analyses in tangible realities. Consequently, economic theory is employed solely to uncover the intricate nuances of our ever-evolving economical landscape. While personal blogs often serve as platforms for self-promotion, I deliberately chose the name ShadowSwiss Economics not to promote myself, but to introduce innovative insights into the Swiss economy. I am Sébastien, a price statistician and economist, with a background in political economy and a master's degree from the University of Geneva.
